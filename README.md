# HumanML3D-MDM
This project is an implementation of Motion Diffusion Model(MDM) using HumanML3D Dataset. 

## 1. HumanML3D Dataset Preparation
Refer this official HumanML3D dataset Github repository 

https://github.com/EricGuo5513/HumanML3D?tab=readme-ov-file\ 

(Warning: Official HumanML3D dataset assumes UNIX environment. If you use Windows OS, you need to change its codes slightly.) 

## 2. Environment Setting
This MDM environment is different from above HumanML3D dataset preprocessing environment.
```txt
scipy           1.13.1
notebook        7.4.5
